This is a very simple temp/fan/voltage monitor for mainboards with the
National Semiconductor LM78 chip. It has been tested on an Asus P2L97-S.

Q1: Why doesn't the CPU temperature show up?
A1: Because I haven't written the necessary code. See Q4.

Q2: Why haven't you written the code for CPU temperature measurements?
A2: Because I don't have a board to test it on. See Q4.

Q3: Why is this program released as freeware? I would have paid several cents for it.
A3: Because it's unsupported. If you find a bug, see Q4.

Q4: Why is the program released with source?
A4: So you can fix it yourself instead of bothering me :-)

Q5: Where is the documentation?
A5: Writing docs is boring. The right mouse button will bring up the menu. Do you need to know more?

Q6: Why have you used this stupid technique to do xxxxx?
A6: Because this was my first attempt on a PM program. Comments are welcome.


Have fun,
